# MCP tools and resources

`syntheo mcp` runs the local MCP server over stdio. It reads and writes only the local database; there is no remote MCP server. Reads are idempotent. Proposal tools insert or decline staged edits; they never apply those edits to the meeting.

| Tool                            | Use                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `list_meetings`                 | Find recent meetings by title, ID fragment, or recurring series. An empty list means none matched; do not invent meetings. |
| `list_folders`                  | List local meeting folder paths. Pass a returned `path` as `list_meetings` `folder_path` to include its subfolders.        |
| `get_meeting`                   | Read metadata, canonical note, summaries, participants, and action items.                                                  |
| `get_meeting_transcript`        | Read a transcript page. Start with `limit: 200`; continue from `pagination.next_offset` only as needed.                    |
| `get_recurring_meeting_history` | Find meetings from the same recurring series as a known meeting.                                                           |
| `export_meeting`                | Read the complete meeting record including transcripts. Use only when smaller reads are insufficient.                      |
| `propose_summary_edit`          | Stage a complete summary replacement. Pass `target_id` when multiple summaries exist.                                      |
| `propose_memo_edit`             | Stage a complete memo replacement.                                                                                         |
| `list_proposals`                | List staged proposals. Defaults to `status: pending`.                                                                      |
| `get_proposal`                  | Read one proposal and its unified `diff`.                                                                                  |
| `decline_proposal`              | Discard a pending proposal without changing the meeting. Applied proposals cannot be declined.                             |

Meeting objects include `folder_path`; it is `null` for meetings outside a folder.

Meeting exports can include optional `speakers` and `speaker_context` fields for transcript rendering. Both fields are optional; do not infer a speaker name when the export lacks evidence.

Transcript limits are measured in words. The default is 200 and the maximum is 500.

Available resources:

- `syntheo://meetings/{meeting_id}`
- `syntheo://meetings/{meeting_id}/transcript{?offset,limit}`
- `syntheo://series/{series_id}`

Prefer tools when the workflow needs structured JSON. Use resources when the client needs concise Markdown or plain-text context. Transcript resources default to 200 words (cap 500) and return plain text only.

## Local recording import

For an explicitly requested audio import, use `import_recording` with `file_path`, optional `title`, an existing `folder_path`, and a stable `request_key` for submission retries. The desktop app must be open on the same machine and database. It creates a real meeting, transcribes the file with the transcription server the user configured in the app, then generates the summary with the configured LLM. The audio is sent to that server. The file is read in place, not copied; it must stay where it is until the job finishes. Supported formats: WAV, MP3, OGG, MP4, M4A, FLAC, WebM, AAC.

Persist `meeting_id` and `job_id`, then poll `get_recording_import` with `job_id`. Do not equate submission with completion. Check both `processing_status` and `summary_status`; `skipped_no_model` and `skipped_too_short` mean no summary was generated. Failure preserves completed meeting data. Reusing a request key returns the existing job, even after failure; do not silently resubmit with a new key. `get_meeting` includes the same status in `recording_import`.
